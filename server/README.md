# gthx server
These are the scripts that run on the server to support gthx's website.

This is currently implemented using old school HTTP requests because I already
had this working and wanted to get the site implemented ASAP. I'll convert it to
REST API style soon.

## Supported parameters
type =
* factoids
* thingiverse
* youtube

range =
* recent
* all

order =
* date
* refs
